<Update label="v3.7.0" description=" Sep 24, 2025">
  This release combines three major updates to `framer-plugin`: the new Navigation API, extended Code File API, and support for Design Pages.

  ## Navigation API

  `framer.navigateTo(nodeId, opts?)` — Programmatically navigate to canvas nodes, collection items, or code files. Supports optional selection, zoom constraints, and field-level scrolling for collection items. Also available in class instances such as `node.navigateTo()`, `collectionItem.navigateTo()`, and `codeFile.navigateTo()`.

  ## Code File API

  `framer.subscribeToOpenCodeFile(cb)` — Subscribe to the currently open code file, enabling plugins to react when users switch between files.

  ## Design Pages API

  Plugins can now read, create, and edit nodes in Design Pages using the same Nodes and Selection APIs you use elsewhere.

  - Works with the existing selection and node methods (for example, `framer.getSelection()` and Node operations)
  - Insert and modify frames, text, and images on Design Pages, just like on other pages
  - Ideal for plugins that generate explorations, moodboards, or asset grids inside a freeform canvas

<Update label="v3.5.2" description=" Jul 25, 2025">
  This new release introduces brand new APIs for creating menus for your plugin.

  ### Added: Menu APIs

  We are introducing new APIs for creating two different types of menu:

  - `setMenu` lets you add a global menu to the plugin window header.
  - `showContextMenu` allows creating context menus anywhere in your plugin.

  ### Added: User APIs

  - New User properties: `avatarUrl` and `initials`

  ### Improved

  - `closePlugin` now returns `never` instead of `Promise<void>`. That means you can treat it like a `throw`, the code that follows will not be reached. Internally `closePlugin` throws `FramerPluginClosedError`, so make sure to ignore it in your exception handlers. `framer-plugin` stops propagation of unhandled errors and rejections of this class, so you don't need to.

<Update label="v3.4.0" description="Jul 15, 2025">
  This new release adds support for Gallery fields to CMS APIs, as well as introducing support for managing code components and overrides via the new Code File API.

  ### Added: Code File API

  We’ve added several new APIs to help plugin authors manage code files:

  - `createCodeFile`, `getCodeFile`, and `getCodeFiles` for creating and retrieving code files
  - `subscribeToCodeFiles` to receive notifications when code files are created or modified
  - `codeFile.setFileContent`, `codeFile.rename`, and `codeFile.remove` to update, rename, and delete code files
  - `codeFile.getVersions` to access a file’s version history

  ### Added: Gallery Fields

  It is now possible to create and update Gallery fields, as well as set values for them when adding or updating items. This is achieved by the creation of a new `"array"` field type.

  - `ManagedCollection.setFields` and `Collection.addFields` support creating Gallery fields.
  - `ManagedCollection.addItems` and `Collection.addItems` let you add values for Gallery fields.
  - `CollectionItem.setAttributes` can now update Gallery field values.

  See our updated CMS guide for more information on working with arrays.

  ### Updated: Collection API

  Deprecated Collection and Managed Collection `readonly` property in favor of `managedBy` and proper permission-based checks via the Permissions API

  ### Updated: User API

  User now has `avatarUrl` and `initials`, and is finally documented.

  ### Fixed: Draggable Component

  Fixed the `<Draggable>` component so that the `altText` parameter is correctly applied when dragging and dropping images, ensuring accessibility metadata isn’t lost.
