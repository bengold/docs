## Navigation API

Use the Navigation API to programmatically navigate the UI to a canvas node, a CMS collection item, or a code file. Plugins can optionally select targets, zoom to canvas layers, or focus a specific field in the item editor.

## Plugin UI

A set of functions for opening and closing the Plugin itself, along with options setting a specific size for your Plugin. Plugins are able to run completely UI-less if desired.

## User APIs

### User

## Code File API

### CodeFile

### CodeFileExport

### CodeFileVersion

## Canvas APIs

### Drag & Drop

### Traits

## CMS APIs

### Collection

### CollectionItem

### EnumCase

### EnumField

### ManagedCollection

## Localization API

### Locale

### LocalizationGroup

### LocalizationSource

### LocalizationValue

## Settings APIs

### Redirect

## Permissions

Plugins can do only what the user can. These APIs let you find out if the methods you need are available to the user, and potentially disable certain functions of your Plugin if not. Learn more with the [Permission guide](/plugins/guides/permissions).

<ParamField header="isAllowedTo()">
  Find out if user's permissions allow them to execute methods.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="subscribeToIsAllowedTo()">
  Subscribe to changes in whether the user is allowed to execute methods.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="useIsAllowedTo()">
  Find out if user's permissions allow them to execute methods, in hook form.
</ParamField>

## Modes

A property with the current mode. Modes are used to understand the context in which the Plugin is being run, and adjust logic as needed. Learn more in the [mode guide](/plugins/guides/modes).

`mode`

## Project

Information about the current Framer Project. Returns the display name of the Project as well as a hashed Project ID. This ID cannot be used to access the Project.

`getProjectInfo()`

## Selection

Functions for reading, setting, or listening to the current selection on the Canvas. The returned list can range from zero items to a very large list of items.

`getSelection()`

`setSelection(nodeIds)`

`subscribeToSelection(callback)`

```typescript
const [selection, setSelection] = useState<CanvasNode[]>([])

useEffect(() => {
    return framer.subscribeToSelection(setSelection)
}, [])

console.log(`Selected ${selection.length} item(s)`)
```

## Assets

A selection of functions for working with Images, Files, and SVGs. The high-level `add` and `set` functions are designed to work in most cases and automatically handle uploading for you. Learn more in the [working with Assets guide](/plugins/guides/assets).

`addImage(imageAsset)`

`setImage(imageAsset)`

`uploadImage(file)`

`uploadFile(file)`

`uploadFiles(files[])`

`addSvg(svgString)`

## Components

Functions for utilising Components in your Plugin. Learn more in the [Component guide](/plugins/guides/components).

`addComponentInstance({ url, attributes })`

`addDetachedComponentLayers({ url, layout, attributes })`

## Text

A selection of functions for working with text layers and their content.

`getText()`

`setText(text)`

`addText(text)`

`subscribeToText(callback)`

## Custom Code

With Custom Code your plugin can install code snippets in a user's Website via `<script>` tags. Custom Code added by a Plugin appears in a separate section of a Projectâ€™s site settings specifically for Plugins. This can be used to load external scripts on a site. Custom code should be valid HTML.

`setCustomCode(options)`

`getCustomCode()`

`subscribeToCustomCode(callback)`

When setting Custom Code, you must provide the html string, as well as a `location`.

```javascript
framer.setCustomCode({
  html: '<script src="https://example.com/script.js"></script>',
  location: "bodyEnd"
})
```

The `location` property has the following values:

- `headStart` - Injects the code snippet at the start of the HTML `<head>` tag
- `headEnd` - Injects the code snippet at the end of the HTML `<head>` tag
- `bodyStart` - Injects the code snippet at the start of the `<body>` tag
- `bodyEnd` - injects the code snippet at the end of the `<body>` tag

Setting the `html` value back to `null` clears the installed code snippet.

```javascript
framer.setCustomCode({
  html: null,
  location: "bodyEnd"
})
```

## Storing Data

Functions for storing data that your Plugin case use across users and sessions. Learn about the different ways to store data in our [Data guide](/plugins/guides/data).

`getPluginData(key)`

`setPluginData(key, value)`

`getPluginDataKeys()`

## Styles

A set of functions for creating, reading and manipulating the Color and Text Styles in a Project. Learn more in our [Styles guide](/plugins/guides/styles).

`createColorStyle(attributes)`

`getColorStyle(id)`

`getColorStyles()`

`subscribeToColorStyles(callback)`

`createTextStyle(attributes)`

`getTextStyle(id)`

`getTextStyles()`

`subscribeToTextStyles(callback)`

## Fonts

Plugins can use typefaces available in the Font Picker to get information about specific fonts or to apply them to [Text Styles](/plugins/guides/styles).

`getFont(family)`

`getFonts()`

Unlike the Font Picker, which groups fonts by typeface, `getFonts` will list individual fonts for each weight and style. You can think these as separate font files.

```javascript
await framer.getFonts()

[
  //..
  {
    family: "Inter",
    weight: 900,
    style: "normal"
  },
  {
    family: "Noto Sans",
    weight: 400,
    style: "normal"
  },
  //..
]
```

To get a specific font from a family, use `getFont` and pass in the family name. This is **not** case sensitive. By default, this will return a font in the family that has a normal weight and style.

```javascript
// Get Noto Sans with a weight of 400 in a normal style.
const font = await framer.getFont("Noto Sans")

// Get Noto Sans with a weight of 800 in an italic style.
const font = await framer.getFont("Noto Sans", {
  weight: 800,
  style: "italic"
})
```

Make sure to check that a font exists before using it. If a font does not exist, `getFont` will return `null`.

<Info>
  **Note:** Custom Fonts are not available to Plugins
</Info>

## Editor

Functions for common actions in the Framer Editor, like going to a specific node on the canvas, or displaying a message in a toast.

`zoomIntoView(nodeId)`

`notify(message, options?: NotifyOptions)`

You can automatically adjust the viewport's pan and zoom so that a node appears in the center. This is the equivalent to using **Zoom to Selection** in the UI, except you can use any list of Nodes.

```typescript
// Scroll and zoom the viewport to show a specific node.
await framer.zoomIntoView("node-id")

// Scroll and zoom to fit multiple nodes into the viewport.
await framer.zoomIntoView(["node-id-1", "node-id-2"])
```

## Nodes

Low-level API for working with Nodes. Useful for doing very specific tasks that may not be covered by the higher-level APIs. Learn more in our [working with Nodes guide](/plugins/guides/nodes).

`createFrameNode(attributes)`

`cloneNode(nodeId)`

`removeNode(nodeId)`

`getCanvasRoot()`

`subscribeToCanvasRoot(callback)`

`getNode(nodeId)`

`getParent(nodeId)`

`getChildren(nodeId)`

`getRect(nodeId)`

`setAttributes(nodeId, attributes)`

`setParent(nodeId, parentId)`

`getNodesWithType(type)`

`getNodesWithAttribute(attribute)`

`getNodesWithAttributeSet(attribute)`

`node.navigateTo(opts)`
